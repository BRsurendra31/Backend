# creating server 

we will create server using expressJS
- we can also do the same using nodejs but might be lenthy.

steps :

- npm init -y (creates package.json without express dependencies )
- go to express.npm 
- copy npm i express , install it in server folder 
(now express dependencies added to json )

- create root file = server.js 

- write server code 
- run it
